** TODO We will be focusing a lot on the crystal clear process instead of just getting the project completed. Read chapters 1 and 4 of the crystal clear PDF file so we know more about the process.
** Jon will look into adding CheckStyle rules to our intelliJ project so our style will be consistent with Dr. Paul's.
** Dr. Paul says we need to use a build tool. We are probably going with Ant.
